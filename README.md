# Sparse Matrix Implementation in C

## Description
This project implements a **sparse matrix** data structure in C using **linked lists**. Sparse matrices are matrices in which most elements are zero, and this implementation is optimized to store and manipulate only the non-zero elements efficiently.
The program supports a variety of operations including insertion, deletion, search, transpose, addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It also includes a **menu-driven interface** for interactive testing and a **file mode** for automated input/output using external files.

### ðŸš€ Features

- Efficient sparse matrix representation using linked lists  
- Insert and update non-zero elements  
- Delete specific elements and clean up empty rows/columns  
- Search for an element at a given position  
- Display the matrix in sparse form (row, col, value)  
- Transpose the matrix in-place  
- Add two sparse matrices (if dimensions match)  
- Subtract one sparse matrix from another  
- Multiply two sparse matrices (with valid dimensions)  
- File Mode: Read matrix data from a file and write updated matrix back  
- Modular code with `main`, `sparse_matrix`, and `test_mode` components  
- Menu-driven interface for easy interaction and testing
